# Arduino VR Headset

This headset is under $100 to create and is completely hackable. It works with any game that takes mouse and keyboard input. For more than $100 you can buy a better set of glasses, I choose these because they were cheap.
It uses an accelerometer to track head motion, the sensor is connected to an Arduino micro that can emulate mouse and keyboard.
